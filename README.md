================

Elasticsearch library to create an elasticsearch client to be able to make requests to elasticsearch.

### elasticsearch package

Includes implementation of a health checker, that reuses the elasticsearch client to check requests can be made against elasticsearch cluster and known indexes.

#### health checker

Using elasticsearch checker function currently performs a GET request against elasticsearch 'cluster health' API (`/_cluster/health"`)

The healthcheck will only succeed if the request can be performend and the cluster is in `green` state.
If the cluster is in `yellow` state, a Checker in WARNING status will be returned. In any other case, a CRITICAL Checker will be returned.

Read the [Health Check Specification](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/master/standards/HEALTH_CHECK_SPECIFICATION.md) for details.

More information about elasticsearch [cluster health API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-health.html)

Instantiate an elasticsearch client
```
import "github.com/ONSdigital/dp-elasticsearch/elasticsearch/v3"

...
    cli := elasticsearch.NewClient(<url>, <maxRetries>, <optional array of indexes>)
...
```

Call elasticsearch health checker with `cli.Checker(context.Background())` and this will return a check object like so:

```json
{
    "name": "string",
    "status": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "status_code": "int",
    "last_checked": "ISO8601 - UTC date time",
    "last_success": "ISO8601 - UTC date time",
    "last_failure": "ISO8601 - UTC date time"
}
```
